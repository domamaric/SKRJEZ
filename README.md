## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of solutions for laboratory exercises assigned throughout the [Scripting Languages](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/predmet/skrjez) course at FER.
The course emphasizes Bash, followed by Perl and Python. The solutions provided here aim to demonstrate various concepts, techniques, and best practices in scripting using these languages.

## Project Overview

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to each scripting language covered in the course. Within each language directory, you will find subdirectories for each
laboratory exercise, containing the solutions along with any necessary resources and/or instructions.

The structure is as follows:
```
- lab	
  - bash/
    - exam/
      - zadatak2_izlazni_test.sh
      - localhost_access_log.2008-02-24.txt
    - zadatak1.sh
    - zadatak2.sh
    ...
- docs
  - bash/
    - Labos1_2024.pdf
    - Unix-shell-programming.pdf
    ...
```

The `docs` folder contains task descriptions for each laboratory exercise and additional resources useful for studying the specific subjects. The `lab` folder contains homework solutions
for Bash, Perl, and Python exercises, including an `exam` folder with solutions for the oral examination part of the laboratory exercises.

## Usage

The solutions provided in this repository are intended to serve as a reference and learning aid. Study the solutions, understand the logic and techniques used, and adapt them to your own projects as needed. However, please refrain from directly copying solutions for assignments or assessments, as it violates academic integrity policies.
