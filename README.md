## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of solutions for laboratory exercises assigned throughout a college course [Scripting Languages](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/predmet/skrjez) at FER . The course emphasizes Bash, followed by Perl and Python. The solutions provided here aim to demonstrate various concepts, techniques, and best practices in scripting using these languages.

## Project Overview

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to each scripting language covered in the course. Within each language directory, you will find subdirectories for each laboratory exercise, containing the solutions along with any necessary resources and/or instructions.

The structure is as follows:
```
- lab	
  - bash/
    - exam/
      - zadatak2_izlazni_test.sh
      - localhost_access_log.2008-02-24.txt
    - zadatak1.sh
    - zadatak2.sh
    ...
- docs
  - bash
    - Labos1_2024.pdf
    - Unix-shell-programming.pdf
    ...
```

`Docs` folder contains task information for each laboratory exercise and/or some useful script for efficient study on specific subject. `Lab` folder contains homework solutions for Bash, Perl and Python exercises as well as `exam` folder which contains solution for oral examination part of laboratory exercise.

## Usage

Each solution provided in this repository is intended to serve as a reference and learning aid. Study the solutions, understand the logic and techniques used, and adapt them to your own projects as needed.
